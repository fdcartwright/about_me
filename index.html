        <p>I was born and am currently living in downtown Bellevue Washington. After high school, I attended Bellevue College in Business Management with emphasis and interest in Computer Science.

        I have worked for the last 6 years in mortgage and real estate sales. At New Tier Real Estate, I was in charge of developing and maintaining the online marketing, including; domain registration, web hosting, web development, SEO, and ad campaigning.
        </p>
        <p>
        I have decided to learn JavaScript at CodeFellow, as I enjoy web development and want to master the skill. A friend of mine went through CodeFellows roughly 7 years ago and is now a Sr. JavaScript Developer at Microsoft.
        </p>
        <p>
        With my base knowledge in web development and the skills I will obtain from CodeFellows, my goal is land a .JS development contract and build a diverse experience coding languages. The goal is to provide me the experience required to land a full-time permanent position with a large Seattle based or remote tech company.
